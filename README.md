## Description
​
Ratatouille is here to make cooking wonderful dishes more enjoyable and less stressful. For home cooks, by home cooks, we provide recipes and culinary guidance. We're all about assisting with "kitchen wins." Although we prefer to utilize fresh, unprocessed ingredients in our recipes, we do acknowledge that canned, frozen, and other prepared foods have their place and time in certain dishes. We support a diet rich in a range of foods, such as whole milk, real butter and cream, extra virgin olive oil, eggs, lots of fruits and vegetables, and protein from dairy, meat, fish, and beans. additional dessert cake
